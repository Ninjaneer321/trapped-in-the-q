<p>A NaNoGenMo “novel”.</p>
<p>“Good day, James. I am happy to show off our newest technical wonder.”</p>
<p>“As you say, Q,” James answered, interested. “What manner of toy do you have for me once again?”</p>
<p>Q picked up a mp3 player. “I realize it looks like a boring mp3 player, but if you unscrew the top, it turns out that it’s actually a WASR-10 Century Arms rifle. Pure protactinium casing, developed during project STATEROOM.”</p>
<p>“Just wondering!” James exclaimed. “That mp3 player certainly will bayer.”</p>
<p>“Please give me your attention, James. This is still in the experimental stage, you realize. Use caution—avoid looking at it.”</p>
<p>James grunted, “Huh, that will do in a pinch on a mission.”</p>
<p>“And,” Q answered, “There is one more thing: if you point it at the sun, it targets your enemy’s tooth, atomizing blood everywhere.”</p>
<p>“Ouch! I dare say that tooth will sleuth.”</p>
<p>“Just one more thing, James. I couldn’t be more excited to present to you Her Majesty’s latest device.”</p>
<p>“As you say, Q,” James intoned, enthusiastically. “What manner of thing do you have for me again?”</p>
<p>Q walked over to an ipod charger. “I understand it looks like a boring ipod charger, but if you rotate it thus, it turns out that it’s truly a boobytrap that shoots lindane. Pure hassium coating, developed during project PICASSO.”</p>
<p>“Crikey!” James exclaimed. “They’ll never expect that ipod charger to sparger.”</p>
<p>“Please give me your attention, James. It hasn’t been perfected yet, one understands. And for God’s sake—don’t use it after midnight.”</p>
<p>James answered, “Yes, that will be useful in the field.”</p>
<p>“At last,” Q said, “There is one more thing: if you point it at the sun, it seeks out your enemy’s leg, shooting cerebrospinal fluid everywhere.”</p>
<p>“Ouch! I dare say that leg will gegg.”</p>
<p>“Next up, James. I am anxious to let you see the department’s latest toy.”</p>
<p>“As you say, Q,” James said, excitedly. “What sort of toy do you have for me again?”</p>
<p>Q picked up a jigsaw puzzle. “I know it looks like an innocent jigsaw puzzle, but if you trigger the remote, in reality it’s revealed to be a Izhmash Saiga-12 12-gauge semiautomatic shotgun. Pure hassium armour, developed during project UTT.”</p>
<p>“Look!” James shouted. “That jigsaw puzzle definitely will muzzle.”</p>
<p>“This is dangerous stuff you know, James. This is still in the experimental stage, you understand. Above all else—don’t breathe on it.”</p>
<p>James intoned, “Hmm, that will come in handy on the go.”</p>
<p>“Finally,” Q replied, “There is an additional note: if you point it at the sun, it precisely targets your enemy’s nose, spraying gastric juice everywhere.”</p>
<p>“Ouch! I dare say that nose will bestows.”</p>
<p>“Next, James. I couldn’t be more excited to present to you the team’s finest latest.”</p>
<p>“As you say, Q,” James replied, curious. “What sort of toy do you have for me this morning?”</p>
<p>Q walked over to a computer. “I know it looks like a simple computer, but if you rotate it thus, in reality it’s revealed to be a grenade that dispenses acrylamide. Pure copper covering, developed during project ARTEMIS.”</p>
<p>“Well done!” James shouted. “That computer definitely will hooter.”</p>
<p>“Please give me your attention, James. This is still in the experimental stage, one understands. Use caution—don’t actually touch it.”</p>
<p>James said, “Mmm, that will be useful .”</p>
<p>“Finally,” Q answered, “There is one last thing: if you wear it like a brooch, it targets your enemy’s lip, shooting sweat everywhere.”</p>
<p>“Yikes! That lip will crip.”</p>
<p>“<em>I say, Q, is this going on much longer? Terribly thirsty.</em>”</p>
<p>“If you have another minute, James. I am happy to show you Her Majesty’s newest toy.”</p>
<p>“Greetings, Q,” James said, bored. “What sort of toy do you have for me this morning?”</p>
<p>Q held up a hanger. “I know it looks like an everyday hanger, but if you rotate it thus, it turns out that it’s really a mine that dispenses nitric oxide. Pure iridium shielding, developed during project PROTON.”</p>
<p>“That’s all good.” James murmured. “That hanger definitely will sanger.”</p>
<p>“Do pay attention, James. It hasn’t been perfected yet, one understands. And for God’s sake—don’t use it after midnight.”</p>
<p>James nodded, “Mmm, that will do in a pinch in the field.”</p>
<p>“And,” Q grunted, “There is an additional note: if you point it at the floor, it seeks out your enemy’s thumb, shooting bile everywhere.”</p>
<p>“Ouch! I dare say that thumb will chum.”</p>
<p>“Even better, James. I am anxious to demonstrate Her Majesty’s newest device.”</p>
<p>“Cheerio, Q,” James answered, bored. “What kind of thing do you have for me this morning?”</p>
<p>Q gestured at a trash bag. “I know it looks like an ordinary trash bag, but if you turn it over, it turns out that it’s uncovered to be a trap that aerosolizes sulfur trioxide. Pure lutetium covering, developed during project CYCLONE-HX9.”</p>
<p>“That’s all good.” James whispered. “They’ll never expect that trash bag to brag.”</p>
<p>“Do pay attention, James. It hasn’t been perfected yet, naturally. And for God’s sake—don’t use it after midnight.”</p>
<p>James intoned, “Huh, that will help out in the field.”</p>
<p>“And,” Q answered, “There is one final feature: if you wear it like a brooch, it targets your enemy’s hip, leaking mucus everywhere.”</p>
<p>“Yikes! That hip will clip.”</p>
<p>“Next up, James. I am anxious to demonstrate our proudest toy.”</p>
<p>“Hullo, Q,” James grunted, staring at his fingernails. “What type of contraption do you have for me once again?”</p>
<p>Q walked over to a hair ribbon. “I understand it looks like a boring hair ribbon, but if you whistle, in fact it’s revealed to be a .30-caliber Universal M1 carbine. Pure bismuth coating, developed during project STINGRAY.”</p>
<p>“Fine.” James murmured. “That hair ribbon will gibbon.”</p>
<p>“Do pay attention, James. It hasn’t been perfected yet, one understands. Whatever you do—avoid jostling it.”</p>
<p>James replied, “Mmm, that will come in handy on a mission.”</p>
<p>“At last,” Q grunted, “There is an additional note: if you put it down your pants, it targets your enemy’s wrist, spraying sebum everywhere.”</p>
<p>“Ouch! Who will expect the wrist to dismissed.”</p>
<p><em>Unfortunately by this point, James had gone several hours without liquor, and died from withdrawl.</em></p>
<p>“Just one more thing, James. I am anxious to present to you my next latest.”</p>
<p>There was no response, but Q continued as if there were.</p>
<p>Q lifted a spool of ribbon. “I know it looks like an ordinary spool of ribbon, but if you unscrew the top, it turns out that it’s really a boobytrap that shoots titanium tetrachloride. Pure vanadium covering, developed during project GODSURGE.”</p>
<p>James said nothing, because he was dead.</p>
<p>“I won’t be responsible if you hurt yourself, James. This needs a bit more research, you understand. Use caution—avoid jostling it.”</p>
<p>“And,” Q replied, “There is an additional note: if you point it at the sun, it targets your enemy’s calf, atomizing pleural fluid everywhere.”</p>
<p>Only the haunting sound of running machinery answered him.</p>
<p>“Even better, James. I am just delighted to show you the team’s latest little trick.”</p>
<p>There was no sound in the room but Q’s own voice.</p>
<p>Q held up a postage stamp. “I understand it looks like an everyday postage stamp, but if you hum, it turns out that it’s uncovered to be a snare that dispenses sulfotep. Pure fermium covering, developed during project FOREMAN.”</p>
<p>James’s body continued to lie there.</p>
<p>“I won’t be responsible if you hurt yourself, James. It hasn’t been perfected yet, you understand. Whatever you do—don’t look at it.”</p>
<p>“Finally,” Q intoned, “There is one final feature: if you point it at yourself, it precisely targets your enemy’s wrist, leaking bile everywhere.”</p>
<p>There was no response as he was the only one still alive in the room.</p>
<p>“Even better, James. I couldn’t be more excited to show off the team’s finest technical wonder.”</p>
<p>There are no reply, as the room was otherwise empty.</p>
<p>Q picked up a puddle. “I understand it looks like an innocent puddle, but if you turn it over, in reality it’s truly a snare that sprays trimethyltin chloride. Pure iron casing, developed during project TRINITY.”</p>
<p>James said nothing, because he was dead.</p>
<p>“This is dangerous stuff you know, James. It hasn’t been perfected yet, of course. Above all else—avoid looking at it.”</p>
<p>“And,” Q intoned, “There is an additional note: if you put it behind your ear, it targets your enemy’s finger, leaking bile everywhere.”</p>
<p>The emptiness of the room echoed terribly.</p>
