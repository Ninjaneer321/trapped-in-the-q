James B. was making one of his usual visits to see the master weaponsmaker at headquarters.
He knew this was an important part of his mission, but sometimes Q could be so tedious!



"Greetings, James. I couldn't be more excited to let you see the team's next toy."

"Indeed, Q," James said, interested. "What sort of prop do you have for me once again?"

Q held up a wisteria bell. "I understand it looks like an ordinary bell, but if you reverse it, in fact it's really a dart gun that aerosolizes phosphamidon. Pure rutherfordium coating, developed during project BLARNEY." 

"Wow!" James shouted. "One always appreciates a fine inventor."

"This is dangerous stuff you know, James. At least pretend to be interested. "Also," Q grunted, "There is one last thing: if you put it down your pants, it precisely targets
    your enemy's cheek, leaking pericardial fluid everywhere." 

"Surely the cheek will leak," James said, in his trademark fashion.

    

"Next, James. I am happy to show off our next device."

"Really, Q," James said, intrigued. "What manner of prop do you have for me once again?"

"I won't be responsible if you hurt yourself, James. At least pretend to be interested. "Anyway," Q said, "There is one more thing: if you wave it counterclockwise, it targets
    your enemy's breast, atomizing mucus everywhere." 

"That breast surely will be compressed," James quipped, as he is wont to do.

    

"Even better, James. I want to demonstrate Her Majesty's next little trick."

"Yes, hello, Q," James intoned, curious. "What manner of surprise do you have for me once again?"

Q picked up a cornflower harmonica. "I realize it looks like a simple harmonica, but if you trigger the remote, in fact it's actually a dart gun that showers the victim with nitrobenzene. Pure curium armour, developed during project CROSSBONES." 

"Yow!" James exclaimed. "Don't come between a man and his free-reed instrument."

"I won't be responsible if you hurt yourself, James. Please take this seriously. "Also," Q answered, "There is an additional note: if you point it at yourself, it is programmed to aim at
    your enemy's lip, leaking tears everywhere." 

"Surely the lip will rip," James quipped, using one of his signature puns.

    

"Just one more thing, James. I am delighted to present to you our one more weapon."

"Really, Q," James intoned, enthusiastically. "What sort of wonder do you have for me once again?"

Q waved his arm towards a blue bell pen. "I understand it looks like an everyday pen, but if you rotate it thus, it turns out that it's revealed to be a boobytrap that rains oxydisulfoton. Pure platinum coating, developed during project CREEK." 

"Easy does it!" James said. "Don't come between a man and his correctional institution."

"Do listen to me, James. At least pretend to be interested. "Anyway," Q intoned, "There is one more thing: if you put it behind your ear, it is programmed to aim at

"That ear surely will buccaneer," James said, in his trademark fashion.

    

"Even better, James. I am anxious to show off Her Majesty's yet another little trick."

"Okay, Q," James intoned, curious. "What type of device do you have for me once again?"

"Agreed!" James replied. "Never leave home without your procyonid."

"Do pay attention, James. At least pretend to be interested. "Anyway," Q said, "There is one more thing: if you put it behind your ear, it seeks out
    your enemy's ear, leaking chyme everywhere." 

"Surely the ear will cohere," James punned, using one of his signature puns.

    

"Also, James. I am anxious to show off the team's next device."

"Do listen to me, James. Please take this seriously. "Also," Q intoned, "There is one final feature: if you point it at the sun, it precisely targets
    your enemy's forearm, shooting chyle everywhere." 

"That forearm certainly will  farm," James said, in his inimical way.

    

"Just one more thing, James. I couldn't be more excited to show off the team's yet another contraption."

"Okay, Q," James intoned, curious. "What manner of toy do you have for me today?"

"Hoo!" James exclaimed. "One always appreciates a fine mug."

"Do pay attention, James. Do act your age. "Anyway," Q answered, "There is one final feature: if you wave it counterclockwise, it is programmed to aim at
    your enemy's eyebrow, leaking earwax everywhere." 

"Well, I dare say that eyebrow will highbrow," James punned, in his trademark fashion.

    

"Next up, James. I couldn't be more excited to demonstrate the department's one more technical wonder."

"Another?, Q," James answered, intrigued. "What manner of surprise do you have for me again?"

Q held up an apricot nail. "I know it looks like an ordinary nail, but if you unscrew the top, in reality it's really a 12-gauge Remington Sportsman sawed-off shotgun. Pure thallium armour, developed during project REMEDY." 

"Is it!" James said. "Never leave home without your attach."

"I won't be responsible if you hurt yourself, James. At least pretend to be interested. "Anyway," Q grunted, "There is an additional note: if you point it at the floor, it seeks out

"Before you go, James. I want to show off my even more exciting weapon."

"If you have another minute, James. I want to let you see my yet another latest."

"Okay, Q," James grunted, interested. "What manner of contraption do you have for me now?"

Q nodded towards an orange scarf. "I understand it looks like an ordinary scarf, but if you unscrew the top, in reality it's uncovered to be a boobytrap that aerosolizes thallium sulfate. Pure mendelevium shielding, developed during project MASTERSHAKE."

"Whoa!" James said. "Don't come between a man and his take away."

    your enemy's tooth, spraying synovial fluid everywhere." 

"Well, I dare say that tooth will luth," James said, as he is wont to do.

    

"Before you go, James. I couldn't be more excited to show you the team's one more contraption."

"Another?, Q," James intoned, curious. "What kind of prop do you have for me now?"

Q picked up a midnight blue coffee pot. "I understand it looks like a simple coffee pot, but if you rotate it thus, in fact it's uncovered to be a trap that dispenses sulfur tetrafluoride. Pure osmium coating, developed during project CREST." 

"When!" James gasped. "I do love a good pot."

"Before you go, James. I am delighted to present to you my even finer device."

"Yes, hello, Q," James replied, curious. "What type of wonder do you have for me today?"

Q walked over to a brown rope. "I understand it looks like an ordinary rope, but if you trigger the remote, in reality it's actually a .357 Ruger Blackhawk revolver. Pure lithium shielding, developed during project OCTAVE." 

"Right!" James replied. "Never leave home without your flunitrazepan."

"Before you go, James. I am delighted to show off our even more exciting little trick."

"Another?, Q," James intoned, curious. "What manner of contraption do you have for me this morning?"

"That eye certainly will  ay," James joked, in his trademark fashion.

    

James cleared his throat. "I say, Q, is this going on much longer? Terribly thirsty, you know."


"Next up, James. I am anxious to demonstrate my even more exciting weapon."

"Do pay attention, James. Please take this seriously. "Anyway," Q intoned, "There is an additional note: if you put it behind your ear, it is programmed to aim at
    your enemy's wrist, atomizing vitreous humour everywhere." 

"Well, I dare say that wrist will twist," James quipped, using one of his signature puns.

    

"Next, James. I want to demonstrate Her Majesty's even more exciting little trick."

"Really, Q," James answered, with obvious boredom. "What kind of contraption do you have for me this morning?"

Q lifted an unmellow yellow canvas. "I know it looks like a boring canvas, but if you unscrew the top, it turns out that it's actually a .223 Bushmaster XM15-E2S rifle. Pure manganese casing, developed during project CADENCE-GAMUT." 

"Huh," James whispered. "I do love a good gym mat."

"Surely the waist will waste," James said, as he is wont to do.

    

"Next, James. I couldn't be more excited to present to you Her Majesty's next technical wonder."

"Another?, Q," James grunted, with indifference. "What manner of thing do you have for me again?"

"That lip certainly will  clip," James joked, using one of his signature puns.

    

"Even better, James. I am delighted to demonstrate the team's next toy."

"Yes, hello, Q," James replied, with obvious boredom. "What sort of prop do you have for me again?"

Q walked over to a razzle dazzle rose stick. "I realize it looks like an ordinary stick, but if you turn it over, it turns out that it's revealed to be a Glock 34. Pure aluminium coating, developed during project CINEPLEX."

"That nose surely will glows," James said, in his inimical way.

"Before you go, James. I am just delighted to demonstrate my next device."

"Just one more thing, James. I am delighted to demonstrate Her Majesty's even more exciting weapon."

"Another?, Q," James nodded, with obvious boredom. "What manner of surprise do you have for me now?"

"All right, Q," James intoned, bored. "What manner of surprise do you have for me this morning?"

Q picked up a forest green fish. "I realize it looks like an everyday fish, but if you hum, in fact it's uncovered to be a 9mm Ruger P89. Pure zirconium covering, developed during project CROSSBONES." 

"Yes well," James whispered. "Don't come between a man and his sign of the zodiac."

"I won't be responsible if you hurt yourself, James. Please take this seriously. "Finally," Q answered, "There is an additional note: if you put it down your pants, it precisely targets
    your enemy's eye, atomizing vomit everywhere." 

"Surely the eye will aye," James said, as he is wont to do.

    

"If you have another minute, James. I am delighted to show you Her Majesty's one more toy."

"Yes, hello, Q," James replied, with obvious boredom. "What type of wonder do you have for me this morning?"

Q gestured at a hot magenta water bottle. "I understand it looks like a simple water bottle, but if you hum, it turns out that it's really a dart gun that showers the victim with arsenous trichloride. Pure vanadium coating, developed during project NIGHTSURF." 

"Yes yes," James whispered. "I do love a good bottle."

"Do pay attention, James. Please take this seriously. "Also," Q intoned, "There is an additional note: if you point it at the floor, it seeks out
    your enemy's wrist, atomizing cerebrospinal fluid everywhere." 

"That wrist surely will mist," James joked, in his trademark fashion.

    

"Next, James. I am delighted to demonstrate the team's next technical wonder."

"All right, Q," James said, with indifference. "What kind of surprise do you have for me once again?"

Q lifted a beaver window. "I know it looks like an everyday window, but if you examine it closely, in reality it's truly a 9mm Beretta. Pure dysprosium coating, developed during project STREETCAR." 

"Huh," James sighed. "One always appreciates a fine period of time."

"I won't be responsible if you hurt yourself, James. Please take this seriously. "Anyway," Q said, "There is one more thing: if you put it behind your ear, it precisely targets
    your enemy's eye, atomizing earwax everywhere." 

"Surely the eye will belie," James quipped, as he is wont to do.

    

"Just one more thing, James. I am happy to present to you our one more latest."

"Really, Q," James nodded, bored. "What sort of contraption do you have for me now?"

Q lifted a mauvelous ladle. "I understand it looks like a boring ladle, but if you whistle, in reality it's uncovered to be a sawed-off Savage Springfield 67H pump-action shotgun. Pure lanthanum armour, developed during project GJALLER." 

"Yes yes," James sighed. "Don't come between a man and his pose."

"Do listen to me, James. Please take this seriously. "Finally," Q nodded, "There is one more thing: if you point it at the sun, it precisely targets
    your enemy's calf, spraying synovial fluid everywhere." 

"Surely the calf will half," James quipped, as he is wont to do.

    

"Before you go, James. I am just delighted to present to you our next technical wonder."

"All right, Q," James replied, with obvious boredom. "What manner of device do you have for me today?"

Q picked up a shocking pink clothes pin. "I understand it looks like an ordinary clothes pin, but if you blink twice, it turns out that it's revealed to be a snare that showers the victim with phenylmercury acetate. Pure manganese coating, developed during project MAINWAY." 

"Fine," James whispered. "Don't come between a man and his fastening."

"Do listen to me, James. Please take this seriously. "Anyway," Q grunted, "There is one more thing: if you point it at yourself, it seeks out
    your enemy's eyebrow, spraying perilymph everywhere." 

"That eyebrow surely will highbrow," James punned, in his trademark fashion.

    

"Also, James. I am anxious to show off our even more exciting latest."

"Another?, Q," James answered, clearly bored. "What manner of wonder do you have for me today?"

Q nodded towards a wisteria hand bag. "I realize it looks like an innocent hand bag, but if you turn it over, in fact it's really a snare that showers the victim with isopropylmethylpyrazolyl dimethylcarbamate. Pure rubidium shielding, developed during project COMMONVIEW." 

"That's all good," James whispered. "I do love a good container."

"Do pay attention, James. At least pretend to be interested. "Finally," Q said, "There is one more thing: if you point it at yourself, it aims at
    your enemy's finger, shooting saliva everywhere." 

"Surely the finger will linger," James quipped, as he is wont to do.

    

"Before you go, James. I am just delighted to let you see the department's even finer weapon."

"All right, Q," James grunted, staring at his fingernails. "What manner of prop do you have for me this morning?"

Q walked over to a goldenrod comb. "I realize it looks like a simple comb, but if you look inside, in reality it's revealed to be a snare that sprays tetraethyl pyrophosphate. Pure magnesium shielding, developed during project GAMUT-UTT." 

"Gee," James sighed. "I do love a good search."

"I won't be responsible if you hurt yourself, James. Do act your age. "Also," Q nodded, "There is one final feature: if you wave it counterclockwise, it seeks out
    your enemy's fist, leaking perilymph everywhere." 

"That fist surely will be dismissed," James joked, using one of his signature puns.

    

"If you have another minute, James. I am happy to demonstrate Her Majesty's yet another technical wonder."

"All right, Q," James intoned, clearly bored. "What sort of prop do you have for me this morning?"

Q held up a dandelion carrot. "I understand it looks like an innocent carrot, but if you blink twice, in reality it's revealed to be a boobytrap that dispenses methyldimethyldithiolanmethyleneaminotirpate carbamic acid. Pure sodium armour, developed during project DROPOUTJEEP." 

"Yes yes," James sighed. "I do love a good reward."

"Do listen to me, James. At least pretend to be interested. "Anyway," Q nodded, "There is one final feature: if you put it behind your ear, it precisely targets
    your enemy's ear, leaking rheum everywhere." 

"Surely the ear will chandelier," James quipped, using one of his signature puns.

    

"Next, James. I am anxious to present to you my even more exciting little trick."

"Yes, hello, Q," James grunted, staring into space. "What manner of thing do you have for me this morning?"

Q gestured at a salmon wine glass. "I realize it looks like an innocent wine glass, but if you speak the launch code, in fact it's uncovered to be a .223 Bushmaster assault rifle. Pure calcium covering, developed during project LOUDAUTO." 

"Yes well," James whispered. "Don't come between a man and his drinking glass."

"Please give me your attention, James. At least pretend to be interested. "Also," Q nodded, "There is one last thing: if you wear it like a brooch, it targets
    your enemy's tooth, spraying sweat everywhere." 

"That tooth certainly will  untruth," James quipped, in his trademark fashion.

    

"If you have another minute, James. I want to demonstrate the department's yet another latest."

"All right, Q," James replied, staring into space. "What sort of wonder do you have for me again?"

Q waved his arm towards an antique brass candle. "I know it looks like an everyday candle, but if you examine it closely, in reality it's revealed to be a boobytrap that dispenses valinomycin. Pure ununquadium shielding, developed during project SOUFFLETROUGH." 

"Yes well," James sighed. "I do love a good examine."

"Do pay attention, James. Please take this seriously. "Also," Q replied, "There is one final feature: if you put it down your pants, it seeks out
    your enemy's eye, spraying chyle everywhere." 

"That eye certainly will  by," James punned, in his inimical way.

    

"Also, James. I am delighted to show off my even finer little trick."

"Another?, Q," James said, with indifference. "What manner of wonder do you have for me once again?"

"Gee," James whispered. "I do love a good icebox."

"Please give me your attention, James. At least pretend to be interested. "Also," Q replied, "There is an additional note: if you wave it counterclockwise, it aims at
    your enemy's hand, atomizing cerebrospinal fluid everywhere." 

"That hand surely will withstand," James quipped, as he is wont to do.

    

"Next, James. I want to present to you Her Majesty's one more little trick."

"Really, Q," James grunted, bored. "What manner of wonder do you have for me now?"

Q gestured at a wild blue yonder shampoo. "I realize it looks like an innocent shampoo, but if you hum, it turns out that it's truly a 12-gauge Remington Sportsman sawed-off shotgun. Pure palladium covering, developed during project GENIE." 

"Gee," James sighed. "Never leave home without your cleanser."

"This is dangerous stuff you know, James. Do act your age. "Finally," Q replied, "There is one last thing: if you wear it like a brooch, it precisely targets
    your enemy's mouth, spraying gastric acid everywhere." 

"That mouth surely will south," James quipped, using one of his signature puns.

    

"Next up, James. I want to show off the department's even more exciting device."

"Okay, Q," James grunted, clearly bored. "What manner of device do you have for me once again?"

Q walked over to a blue violet light. "I know it looks like an innocent light, but if you whistle, in reality it's really a .22-caliber Walther P22 semiautomatic. Pure yttrium coating, developed during project VAGRANT." 

"That's all good," James sighed. "Never leave home without your brainwave."

"Do pay attention, James. At least pretend to be interested. "Also," Q replied, "There is one more thing: if you point it at the floor, it is programmed to aim at
    your enemy's breast, shooting gastric juice everywhere." 

"Well, I dare say that breast will contest," James said, in his trademark fashion.

    

"Also, James. I couldn't be more excited to demonstrate my even more exciting device."

"Really, Q," James intoned, clearly bored. "What kind of surprise do you have for me once again?"

Q gestured at a wild watermelon candlestick. "I understand it looks like an innocent candlestick, but if you hum, in reality it's really a Intratec DC-9. Pure ruthenium covering, developed during project GOURMETTROUGH." 

"Gee," James whispered. "I do love a good holder."

    your enemy's head, atomizing pleural fluid everywhere." 

"That head surely will be imbed," James quipped, in his inimical way.

    

"Just one more thing, James. I am anxious to demonstrate the department's next weapon."

"Yes, hello, Q," James grunted, clearly tired. "What manner of contraption do you have for me again?"

"Yes yes," James whispered. "Don't come between a man and his move."

"I won't be responsible if you hurt yourself, James. Please take this seriously. "Anyway," Q said, "There is one final feature: if you point it at the floor, it is programmed to aim at
    your enemy's ear, shooting pus everywhere." 

"That ear surely will chandelier," James joked, in his inimical way.

    

"Just one more thing, James. I am delighted to let you see the team's next weapon."

"Another?, Q," James said, with indifference. "What kind of prop do you have for me now?"

"Huh," James murmured. "I do love a good ball."

"I won't be responsible if you hurt yourself, James. Do act your age. "Anyway," Q intoned, "There is one more thing: if you point it at yourself, it precisely targets
    your enemy's arm, shooting blood everywhere." 

"Surely the arm will harm," James punned, using one of his signature puns.

    

"Before you go, James. I am happy to show off the department's next contraption."

"Okay, Q," James grunted, brushing a speck of dust off his tuxedo. "What sort of toy do you have for me today?"

Q held up a blue pair of tongs. "I understand it looks like an everyday pair of tongs, but if you hum, it turns out that it's actually a snare that aerosolizes mercuric oxide. Pure meitnerium coating, developed during project WISTFULTOLL." 

"Yes well," James sighed. "One always appreciates a fine device."

James said nothing, because he was dead.

"I won't be responsible if you hurt yourself, James. Do act your age. "Also," Q intoned, "There is one final feature: if you point it at the sun, it seeks out
    your enemy's ear, spraying chyme everywhere." 

There was no response as he was the only one still alive in the room.

    

"Even better, James. I couldn't be more excited to show you the team's next technical wonder."

"Do pay attention, James. Do act your age. "Also," Q replied, "There is an additional note: if you wear it like a brooch, it is programmed to aim at
    your enemy's ear, shooting rheum everywhere."

"Please give me your attention, James. At least pretend to be interested. "Finally," Q intoned, "There is one last thing: if you put it down your pants, it precisely targets
    your enemy's ear, spraying saliva everywhere."

James said nothing, because he was dead.

"Do pay attention, James. Please take this seriously. "Anyway," Q replied, "There is one last thing: if you point it at yourself, it seeks out
    your enemy's ear, leaking cerebrospinal fluid everywhere." 

The emptiness of the room echoed terribly.

James's body continued to lie there.

"This is dangerous stuff you know, James. Please take this seriously. "Anyway," Q nodded, "There is one last thing: if you put it behind your ear, it is programmed to aim at
    your enemy's ear, spraying blood everywhere."
