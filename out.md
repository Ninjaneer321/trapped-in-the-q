## A "spy" "novel."
### By Liza Daly for NaNoGenMo 2016

James B. was making one of his usual visits to see the master weaponsmaker at headquarters.
He knew this was an important part of his mission, but sometimes Q could be so tedious!



"Howdy, James. I am anxious to let you see Her Majesty's latest gadget."

"Greetings, Q," James said, intrigued. "What sort of prop do you have for me this morning?"

Q gestured at a bag. "I know it looks like a simple bag, but if you examine it closely, in reality it's revealed to be a trap that showers the victim with ammonia. Pure fermium coating, developed during project SOMBERKNAVE."

"Over!" James said. "One always appreciates a fine indefinite quantity."

"Do pay attention, James," Q sighed. "At least pretend to be interested. Anyway," Q grunted, "If you point it at yourself, it is programmed to fire at
    your enemy's hip, leaking pleural fluid everywhere."

"Well, I dare say that hip will nip," James joked, as he is wont to do.



"Just one more thing, James. I am delighted to show off our even finer device."

"Really, Q," James said, interested. "What kind of surprise do you have for me again?"

Q picked up a wrench. "I realize it looks like an everyday wrench, but if you whistle, it turns out that it's uncovered to be a boobytrap that sprays arsenic pentoxide. Pure ruthenium casing, developed during project IVYBELLS."

"Oh!" James shouted. "Don't come between a man and his wound."

"I won't be responsible if you hurt yourself, James," Q said. "Please take this seriously. Anyway," Q said, "If you point it at the floor, it is programmed to fire at
    your enemy's shoulder, shooting sputum everywhere."

"That shoulder certainly will  folder," James said, in his trademark fashion.



"Also, James. I am anxious to show you the department's one more toy."

"All right, Q," James intoned, in anticipation. "What kind of surprise do you have for me this morning?"

Q lifted a bag. "I realize it looks like a simple bag, but if you rotate it thus, in fact it's uncovered to be a .223-caliber Smith & Wesson M&P15 semiautomatic rifle. Pure cadmium covering, developed during project EBSR."

"Whee!" James gasped. "Never leave home without your mammary gland."

"Do pay attention, James," Q complained. "Please take this seriously. Finally," Q replied, "If you put it behind your ear, it is programmed to fire at
    your enemy's chin, shooting gastric acid everywhere."

"That chin surely will gin," James joked, in his inimical way.



"Even better, James. I am just delighted to let you see Her Majesty's yet another little trick."

"All right, Q," James said, interested. "What manner of toy do you have for me this morning?"

Q held up a candy cane. "I understand it looks like an innocent candy cane, but if you reverse it, it turns out that it's truly a trap that aerosolizes fluorine. Pure protactinium covering, developed during project AIRGAP-COZEN."

"How!" James gasped. "I do love a good candy."

"I won't be responsible if you hurt yourself, James," Q complained. "At least pretend to be interested. Finally," Q grunted, "If you wave it counterclockwise, it seeks out
    your enemy's ankle, spraying gastric juice everywhere."

"That ankle certainly will  rankle," James said, in his inimical way.



"Just one more thing, James. I am just delighted to show you the department's even more exciting little trick."

"All right, Q," James grunted, in anticipation. "What kind of device do you have for me once again?"

Q gestured at a microphone. "I understand it looks like an ordinary microphone, but if you blink twice, in reality it's revealed to be a snare that shoots amiton. Pure thorium shielding, developed during project BEAMER."

"Oopsey!" James exclaimed. "Don't come between a man and his electro-acoustic transducer."

"Please give me your attention, James," Q said with exasperation. "Do act your age. Also," Q nodded, "If you put it down your pants, it is programmed to fire at
    your enemy's arm, leaking amniotic fluid everywhere."

"Surely the arm will alarm," James said, using one of his signature puns.



"Just one more thing, James. I am just delighted to present to you the team's even finer contraption."

"Okay, Q," James said, enthusiastically. "What kind of contraption do you have for me once again?"

Q waved his arm towards a drawer. "I understand it looks like a boring drawer, but if you rotate it thus, it turns out that it's revealed to be a 12-gauge Winchester 1300 pump-action shotgun. Pure fermium casing, developed during project CYBERTRANS."

"Gee!" James said. "Never leave home without your money dealer."

"Do listen to me, James," Q complained. "At least pretend to be interested. Also," Q answered, "If you point it at the sun, it targets
    your enemy's wrist, atomizing chyle everywhere."

"Surely the wrist will be hissed," James joked, using one of his signature puns.



"Even better, James. I am just delighted to present to you my yet another technical wonder."

"Yes, hello, Q," James replied, intrigued. "What type of thing do you have for me again?"

Q gestured at a twister. "I realize it looks like an everyday twister, but if you blink twice, in fact it's actually a snare that dispenses trimethyltin chloride. Pure tantalum coating, developed during project GROWLER."

"My!" James replied. "Don't come between a man and his friedcake."

"This is dangerous stuff you know, James," Q sighed. "Do act your age. Anyway," Q nodded, "If you wear it like a brooch, it fires at
    your enemy's wrist, atomizing tears everywhere."

"Well, I dare say that wrist will schist," James quipped, using one of his signature puns.

"Blast!" James exclaimed. "One always appreciates a fine union."

"I won't be responsible if you hurt yourself, James," Q said. "Do act your age. Anyway," Q grunted, "If you wear it like a brooch, it is programmed to fire at
    your enemy's hand, leaking mucus everywhere."

Q lifted a baseball bat. "I know it looks like an everyday baseball bat, but if you trigger the remote, in fact it's actually a dart gun that showers the victim with 6-diisocyanate toluene. Pure tantalum shielding, developed during project OCTAVE."

"Yes well," James whispered. "One always appreciates a fine bat."

"Please give me your attention, James," Q complained. "At least pretend to be interested. Also," Q replied, "If you point it at yourself, it fires at
    your enemy's breast, spraying chyle everywhere."

"Surely the breast will be assessed," James quipped, in his trademark fashion.



"Before you go, James. I am delighted to present to you Her Majesty's yet another contraption."

"Yes, hello, Q," James said, staring at his fingernails. "What sort of prop do you have for me now?"

Q lifted a keyboard. "I understand it looks like an innocent keyboard, but if you examine it closely, in reality it's truly a trap that showers the victim with amphetamine. Pure ununquadium casing, developed during project SPOTBEAM."

"That's all good," James mumbled. "Don't come between a man and his holder."

"I won't be responsible if you hurt yourself, James," Q complained. "Do act your age. Anyway," Q intoned, "If you wear it like a brooch, it seeks out
    your enemy's neck, leaking tears everywhere."

"Surely the neck will feck," James punned, using one of his signature puns.



"Before you go, James. I couldn't be more excited to let you see my even finer latest."

"All right, Q," James intoned, staring at his fingernails. "What manner of contraption do you have for me this morning?"

Q waved his arm towards a bracelet. "I know it looks like a boring bracelet, but if you look inside, in reality it's actually a snare that aerosolizes phenylthiourea. Pure neptunium casing, developed during project EGOTISTICALGIRAFFE."

"Gee," James murmured. "Never leave home without your band."

"Do pay attention, James," Q sighed. "At least pretend to be interested. Also," Q replied, "If you wave it counterclockwise, it shoots at
    your enemy's ear, atomizing gastric juice everywhere."

"Well, I dare say that ear will bombardier," James punned, in his trademark fashion.



"Just one more thing, James. I am anxious to demonstrate our next weapon."

"Yes, hello, Q," James answered, clearly tired. "What sort of surprise do you have for me this morning?"

Q lifted an apple. "I realize it looks like a simple apple, but if you unscrew the top, in reality it's truly a dart gun that shoots azinphos-ethyl. Pure ununpentium covering, developed during project CYBERTRANS."

"Fine," James murmured. "Never leave home without your apple tree."

"This is dangerous stuff you know, James," Q said with exasperation. "Do act your age. Finally," Q nodded, "If you wave it counterclockwise, it targets
    your enemy's eye, atomizing tears everywhere."

"That eye certainly will  ally," James joked, in his trademark fashion.



"Even better, James. I am anxious to demonstrate Her Majesty's yet another little trick."

"All right, Q," James said, clearly bored. "What sort of contraption do you have for me this morning?"

Q walked over to a hand bag. "I realize it looks like a boring hand bag, but if you speak the launch code, in reality it's actually a .357-caliber Ruger Security Six. Pure seaborgium covering, developed during project SCHOOLMONTANA."

"Yes yes," James mumbled. "One always appreciates a fine container."

"I won't be responsible if you hurt yourself, James," Q complained. "Please take this seriously. Anyway," Q grunted, "If you put it down your pants, it shoots at
    your enemy's finger, spraying sebum everywhere."

"Well, I dare say that finger will linger," James said, as he is wont to do.



"Also, James. I am delighted to show you Her Majesty's yet another technical wonder."

"Yes, hello, Q," James intoned, clearly bored. "What sort of prop do you have for me again?"

Q picked up a crow. "I understand it looks like a simple crow, but if you rotate it thus, it turns out that it's uncovered to be a snare that sprays phenol. Pure lutetium covering, developed during project IVYBELLS."

"That's all good," James sighed. "Never leave home without your constellation."

"Do pay attention, James," Q said with exasperation. "Please take this seriously. Anyway," Q said, "If you point it at the sun, it fires at
    your enemy's cheek, spraying chyle everywhere."

"That cheek certainly will  pique," James said, using one of his signature puns.



"Next up, James. I want to show you Her Majesty's even finer technical wonder."

"Okay, Q," James answered, clearly bored. "What manner of wonder do you have for me again?"

Q nodded towards a comb. "I realize it looks like a simple comb, but if you whistle, in reality it's uncovered to be a boobytrap that rains acrolein. Pure cadmium armour, developed during project ARCANAPUP."

"Yes well," James mumbled. "One always appreciates a fine crest."

"Do pay attention, James," Q said with exasperation. "Do act your age. Finally," Q said, "If you wear it like a brooch, it targets
    your enemy's foot, atomizing pleural fluid everywhere."

"That foot certainly will  underfoot," James said, in his inimical way.



"Before you go, James. I want to present to you my even finer device."

"Another?, Q," James replied, obviously uninterested. "What type of device do you have for me once again?"

Q nodded towards a puddle. "I know it looks like a boring puddle, but if you speak the launch code, it turns out that it's actually a WASR-10 Century Arms rifle. Pure tungsten armour, developed during project SCORPIOFORE-CPE."

"Gee," James sighed. "I do love a good confuse."

"Please give me your attention, James," Q said with exasperation. "Please take this seriously. Also," Q grunted, "If you put it down your pants, it seeks out
    your enemy's forearm, atomizing chyme everywhere."

"That forearm certainly will  underarm," James quipped, using one of his signature puns.



"Also, James. I am anxious to show off my yet another toy."

"Another?, Q," James replied, obviously uninterested. "What type of toy do you have for me today?"

Q gestured at a butter knife. "I realize it looks like a simple butter knife, but if you speak the launch code, in fact it's really a snare that showers the victim with warfarin sodium. Pure cesium shielding, developed during project DOUBLEARROW."

"Yes yes," James sighed. "Don't come between a man and his table knife."

"Do pay attention, James," Q sighed. "Do act your age. Finally," Q said, "If you point it at yourself, it shoots at
    your enemy's thigh, shooting lymph everywhere."

"Well, I dare say that thigh will by," James quipped, in his trademark fashion.



"Even better, James. I am happy to show you the department's even more exciting contraption."

"Really, Q," James answered, with obvious boredom. "What manner of surprise do you have for me again?"

Q waved his arm towards a thread. "I know it looks like a boring thread, but if you trigger the remote, in fact it's revealed to be a FIE .380-caliber Star semiautomatic. Pure potassium armour, developed during project FASTSCOPE."

"That's all good," James whispered. "I do love a good extract."

"Do listen to me, James," Q sighed. "Do act your age. Finally," Q said, "If you wave it counterclockwise, it precisely targets
    your enemy's arm, spraying rheum everywhere."

"That arm surely will rearm," James joked, using one of his signature puns.



"Just one more thing, James. I am anxious to demonstrate Her Majesty's even finer technical wonder."

"Yes, hello, Q," James nodded, staring at his fingernails. "What manner of contraption do you have for me once again?"

Q held up a rug. "I realize it looks like an ordinary rug, but if you trigger the remote, in reality it's really a 12-gauge sawed-off Savage Stevens 311D. Pure rhenium covering, developed during project CROSSBONES."

"Huh," James whispered. "I do love a good furnishing."

"This is dangerous stuff you know, James," Q said. "Do act your age. Also," Q replied, "If you put it down your pants, it targets
    your enemy's hair, leaking bile everywhere."

"Surely the hair will dispair," James joked, in his inimical way.



_Unfortunately by this point, James had gone several hours without liquor, and died from withdrawal._


"Just one more thing, James. I am anxious to let you see the team's even finer weapon."

There was no sound in the room but Q's own voice.

Q held up a rug. "I know it looks like an everyday rug, but if you reverse it, it turns out that it's uncovered to be a .30-caliber Universal M1 carbine. Pure lanthanum shielding, developed during project BELLVIEW."

James said nothing, because he was dead.

"I won't be responsible if you hurt yourself, James," Q said with exasperation. "Do act your age. Also," Q answered, "If you put it down your pants, it is programmed to fire at
    your enemy's hair, spraying cerebrospinal fluid everywhere."

Only the haunting sound of running machinery answered him.



"Next up, James. I couldn't be more excited to present to you the department's yet another weapon."

There was no response, but Q continued as if there were.

Q held up a rug. "I know it looks like a boring rug, but if you rotate it thus, it turns out that it's really a .45-caliber Colt semiautomatic. Pure cobalt coating, developed during project VAGRANT."

James's body continued to lie there.

"I won't be responsible if you hurt yourself, James," Q said. "Do act your age. Also," Q replied, "If you put it behind your ear, it is programmed to fire at
    your enemy's hair, leaking peritoneal fluid everywhere."

There was no response, which did not dampen Q's enthusiasm.



"Even better, James. I couldn't be more excited to present to you Her Majesty's one more weapon."

There was no reply, as the room was otherwise empty.

Q waved his arm towards a rug. "I know it looks like a boring rug, but if you unscrew the top, it turns out that it's revealed to be a dart gun that aerosolizes titanium tetrachloride. Pure molybdenum covering, developed during project AIGHANDLER."

James said nothing, because he was dead.

"I won't be responsible if you hurt yourself, James," Q said with exasperation. "Please take this seriously. Anyway," Q grunted, "If you wave it counterclockwise, it precisely targets
    your enemy's hair, atomizing aqueous humour everywhere."

The emptiness of the room echoed terribly.



"If you have another minute, James. I am happy to present to you the team's even more exciting technical wonder."

There was no reply, as the room was otherwise empty.

Q gestured at a rug. "I know it looks like a simple rug, but if you unscrew the top, in reality it's revealed to be a trap that aerosolizes trifluoromethyl-benzenamine. Pure barium covering, developed during project YELLOWSTONE-SPLITGLASS."

James's body continued to lie there.

"I won't be responsible if you hurt yourself, James," Q said, rolling his eyes. "Please take this seriously. Finally," Q nodded, "If you point it at yourself, it seeks out
    your enemy's hair, shooting blood serum everywhere."

There was no response, which did not dampen Q's enthusiasm.

The emptiness of the room echoed terribly.

Q walked over to a rug. "I know it looks like an everyday rug, but if you turn it over, in reality it's actually a mine that shoots bicycloheptane-carbonitrile. Pure californium coating, developed during project MAINWAY."

James said nothing, because he was dead.

"Do pay attention, James," Q sighed. "Please take this seriously. Anyway," Q answered, "If you point it at yourself, it fires at

The emptiness of the room echoed terribly.

"This is dangerous stuff you know, James," Q said with exasperation. "Do act your age. Finally," Q said, "If you wear it like a brooch, it is programmed to fire at
    your enemy's hair, shooting tears everywhere."

The emptiness of the room echoed terribly.

James's body continued to lie there.

"Do pay attention, James," Q sighed. "Do act your age. Also," Q answered, "If you point it at the floor, it is programmed to fire at
